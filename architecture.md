#Architecture

Let's focus specifically on the client-side architecture, which will handle local data management and synchronization preparation:

## Core Components

* **DatabaseManager**: Core interface for all database operations
* **SchemaManager**: Sets up database structure and change tracking
* **SyncQueue**: Manages ordered processing of outgoing and incoming changes
* **SyncWorker**: Background process handling actual sync operations
* **ConflictResolver**: Local conflict detection and resolution
* **ConnectionMonitor**: Network availability tracking

## Flow

1. **Local Change Management**
   * SQLite triggers capture all CRUD operations in real-time
   * Changes are logged to `__pocketsync_changes` table with metadata
   * Each change includes a local version number and timestamp
   * A notification system alerts the sync engine about new changes

2. **Change Preparation**
   * SyncQueue maintains an ordered list of pending changes
   * Changes are grouped and prioritized based on entity relationships
   * SyncWorker processes the queue when appropriate

3. **Network Awareness**
   * ConnectionMonitor tracks network availability
   * Sync operations only proceed when connection is available
   * Bandwidth-sensitive mode for metered connections is supported

4. **Local Conflict Detection**
   * Before sending changes, check for local conflicts
   * Resolve conflicts according to configured strategy
   * Potentially notify user about significant conflicts

5. **Sync Operation Planning**
   * Prepare changes in batches for efficiency
   * Calculate optimal sync strategy based on:
     * Number of pending changes
     * Time since last sync
     * Network quality
     * Battery status

6. **Persistence and Recovery**
   * Queue state persists across app restarts
   * Failed operations are marked for retry
   * Exponential backoff for repeated failures
   * Circuit breaker prevents excessive retry attempts

7. **Background Sync**
   * Periodic background sync attempts when app is not active
   * Platform-specific background processing (WorkManager, BackgroundFetch)
   * Respect system battery and data-saving modes

8. **User Experience**
   * Sync status indicators in UI
   * Configurable sync frequency and conditions
   * Manual sync option for immediate synchronization
   * Activity log for sync operations

9. **Local Housekeeping**
   * Automatic cleanup of synced changes after retention period
   * Database optimization to prevent bloat
   * Sync statistics collection for diagnostics

## Architecture Benefits

* **Resilience**: Works reliably despite connectivity issues
* **Efficiency**: Minimizes battery and data usage
* **Transparency**: User knows sync status at all times
* **Flexibility**: Configurable to suit different use cases
* **Minimal Friction**: Synchronization happens automatically when appropriate
* **Graceful Degradation**: Functions even when sync is delayed or failing
